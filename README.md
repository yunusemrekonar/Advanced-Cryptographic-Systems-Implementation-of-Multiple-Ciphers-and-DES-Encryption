# Advanced-Cryptographic-Systems-Implementation-of-Multiple-Ciphers-and-DES-Encryption
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of cryptographic algorithms, including classical ciphers (Caesar, Affine, Monoalphabetic, Polyalphabetic) as well as the modern Data Encryption Standard (DES). The project showcases the implementation of key generation, encryption, and decryption processes for each cipher. Additionally, the repository provides methods for hacking certain ciphers to demonstrate their weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This all-in-one cryptography toolkit is designed for educational purposes, allowing users to understand and compare different cryptographic techniques across various levels of complexity.
